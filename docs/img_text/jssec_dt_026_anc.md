The figure shows an example of a mapping of code (classes and instances)
to their protection domains and then to their permissions.

In this figure, the code is represented by five classes,
`a.class`{.codeph}, `b.class`{.codeph}, `c.class`{.codeph},
`d.class`{.codeph}, and `e.class`{.codeph}.

The figure has two domains named A and B. `a.class`{.codeph} and
`c.class`{.codeph} map to domain A while `b.class`{.codeph},
`d.class`{.codeph}, and `e.class`{.codeph} map to domain B. Each domain
maps to its own set of permissions.

The security policy consists of the protection domains and the
permissions to which they map.
