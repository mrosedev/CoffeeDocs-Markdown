This figure illustrates a thread of computation that has a chain of
multiple callers as multiple method calls that cross protection domain
boundaries. Four classes are listed: `AC.class`{.codeph},
`file.class`{.codeph}, `c.class`{.codeph}, and `a.class`{.codeph}.
`c.class`{.codeph} belongs to domain A. `a.class`{.codeph} belongs to
domain B. Each domain has been granted their own set of permissions. The
security policy consists of both domains and their permissions.
